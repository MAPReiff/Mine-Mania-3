# Mine Mania 3

Mine Mania 3 is the 3rd geration of the Mine Mania mod from 2014. The orginagl two mods, MineMania and MineMania Rebrith, totaled over 5300 downloads in their life spans. Due to the massive changes between 1.7.10 and 1.8 however, I dropped development until now.

### Versions
As new versions of the mod and Forge become available, I will update the table bellow.
